There are two programs net_server.py net_client.py. Both programs import socket in order to communicate.
Both programs are set to port 40,000. In order for these programs to work, start net_server.py
then start net_client.py. net_client.py will print 1 one to one hundred and net_server.p will 
concatenate "WoW Queue: " with the current forloop count.
